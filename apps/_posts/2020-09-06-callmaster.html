<p>Managing phone calls has suffered an upgrade. This app allows users to combine the power to record the calls (only amongst users) and gives total control of contact customisation and blocking.</p>

<p>Each and every action has been carefully selected to enhance caller's experience while having a clear overvirew of the status. Storage, volume, audio quality, anything can be tuned!</p>
