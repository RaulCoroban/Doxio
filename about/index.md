First things first. <i>Doxio</i> is the pseudoname that came to me a long time ago. (If you ask, I might not even be able to answer you from where). My name is Raul Coroban.

Currently, I am a Bioinformatics and Systems Biology MSc student at [Vrije Universiteit](https://www.vu.nl/en). "Ok, then why..." Am I doing this? Yeah, well, it's a long story.

I started my 4-years Computer Science BSc at the [Polytechnic University of Valencia](http://www.upv.es/) and I specialized on Software Engineering. During this time, I developed all the design skills of a UX/UI designer (in paralell with my studies) enriched with the [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) perspective which have been applied to the developed projects.

As an active member of the [ACM UPV Chapter](https://acmupv.webs.upv.es) in charge of the promotion of our chapter and activities, I've also acquired some skills on Graphic design, besides other soft skills derived of the association management.

What about now? Well, I'll continue adding material to this website, but most of it will be dedicated to personal projects, which will be sorted under 3 series: SHARE, COLLABORATE & REALITY. Stay tuned to see what they can be about ðŸ˜‰.

Thank you for your time!
