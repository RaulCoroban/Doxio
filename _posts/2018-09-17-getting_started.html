<p>Under the remaining sections you can find a part of my work as UX/UI freelance designer.  </p>

<p>As there is a variety of platforms for which I've developed projects and one might get confused of what kind of work is looking at due to a possible ambiguous presentation, here is a quick tutorial about it:</p>

<h3>Printed material</h3>
All the designs ready for a physical platform (from posters to brochures) have been rotated 15° left for their presentation. They keep a normalized size so most of the visible part can be observed in a standard screen. Also, if the project involves different sizes of paper, these keep their proportion in relation to the rest of elements.

Said in other words, designs should entirely fit the screen (hopefully), and if you see a big portrait-oriented rectangle and a small one, the first is probably a poster and the second a brochure or a business card. Remember to tilt your head for a correct view!

<h3>Web designs</h3>
This time 15° right. Yes, this have been made to relax your neck. I don't want you to get your muscles contracted!

Same as above, sizeas have been adapted, but there's one thing more to keep in mind. The websites that include forms may have very very very similar pages, so for the presentation, they've been reduced to some samples.

<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
Now your neck muscles are warm, just keep them straight for the next category: Apps! It's easy, just keep your head straight (you can look a them upside down if you want, they're pretty anyway).
