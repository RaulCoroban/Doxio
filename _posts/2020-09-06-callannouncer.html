<p>Wanna know who's calling? Or who's messaging you? Too busy/far to look at the phone? CallAnnouncer got you covered. A totally customisable announcer can let you know what does you last WhatsApp notification say. And read it out loud!</p>

<p>And it works across most of the communication apps!</p>
