<p><a href="https://women.acm.org">ACM-W</a> is an international comitee part of the <a href="http://acm.org/">ACM (Association for Computer Machinery)</a> whose main mission is to promote women participation in all the fields related to Computer Science.</p>
<p>&quot;ACM-W: Informática para tod@s&quot; joined a family of thriving events aimed to make visible women figures in Computer Science in a cozy environment where sharing ideas and showing values are the special guests. As its name denotes, this is a local spanish event derived from the <a href="https://womencourage.acm.org/2018/">WomEncourage</a> ACM-W event, and starting out it journey on 2016's summer.</p>

<p>As part of the local ACM UPV Student Chapter of Valencia, and assuming the role of designer and starting from the first edition, I created all the graphics of the event, from posters and brochures to custom slides, establishing the brand of the celebration from the beginning. </p>

<p>The valencian city was the first one to hold this kind of <a href="https://ipt.acm.org/ipt-2016/">event</a> at the Computer Science Faculty of the Polytechnic University of Valencia. As it was the very beginning of a hopefully long-lasting journey, the hole design started from scratch. The logo contains both female and male symbols joined in the same shape, combined with the circular-shaped ending, common in electronic chips representation. </p>
