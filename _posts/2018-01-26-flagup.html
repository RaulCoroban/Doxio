<p>Need a break or oil change? Or maybe a in-depth inspection? Tell <a href="http://setflagup.com">FlagUp</a> what you need and it will solve it for you!</p>

<p>By posting a request on the website with a few details about your vehicle, FlagUp is able to find you the best choice, either filtered by price or by distance. Ok, but how can I do this?</p>

<h1>The Web &#x1F310</h1>
<p> A universal web platform to access the tool. First, one must enter <a href="http://setflagup.com">the website</a> and fill in the form, which consists of 6-8 steps. A simple interface is provided for each so it only asks for a specific field.</p>

<p>On the Repair Shop side, requests are received so they can offer an accurate quote to the client while watching what competitors have to say about the same job.</p>

<h1>The App &#x1F4F1</h1>
Also, FlagUp can be accessed from an iOS platform. The interface offers again uncluttered information, keeping it all simple.

<h1>The Promo &#x1F6A9</h1>
<p>As this is a brave entrepreneur project, some promotion is needed in order to attract investors attention. This is why we have a promo material for pitches (right) with full information about the benefits of joining the tool, and also collaboration flyers (left).</p>

<p>And if the team has convinced you, we have to make sure you can contact us. Classic tactic. Business cards (magnifying glass).</p>
