<p>There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Ghost editor</p>
<p>If you've gotten pretty comfortable with <a href="/the-editor/">all the basics</a> of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>
<p>As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.</p>
<h2 id="specialformatting">Special formatting</h2>
<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>strike through</s></li>
<li><mark>highlight</mark></li>
<li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writingcodeblocks">Writing code blocks</h2>
<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>
<pre><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fullbleedimages">Full bleed images</h2>
<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/project-ipt-valencia.jpg" alt="walking"></p>
<p>which is styled with...</p>
<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {
    max-width: 100vw;
}
</code></pre>
